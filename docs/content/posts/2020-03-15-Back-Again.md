# Enter the large time allocator

On December 10, 2019 I fully expected to keep working on the project, but...

... A larger series of personal commitments arrived on my door.
I am back working on this project for a limited time.

# A few months ago ...

I was attempting to write a version of this code for SLD2.
I had the following problems:

* loading of external .dll from my programs distribution.
* Interfacing new .dll and the ability of grovel routines to find the gcc compiler under mingw64.

# I have been tweeking my emacs and slime setup to allow the use of a mingw64 compiled sbcl. This all seems to work so far.
I want to retry this with the-invaders.
