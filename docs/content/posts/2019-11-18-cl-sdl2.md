title: The SDL 2 Way in LISP

### On the Lispificaition of foreign code

MY preference is to have LISP version of external .dll and/or .so code to closely follow the API of the original software, so I can take example code in other languages to "find the way" of the API.
I faced several days of learning the [lisp-builder-sdl](https://github.com/lispbuilder/lispbuilder/tree/master/lispbuilder-sdl) way for sdl1.2 from their [examples,](https://github.com/lispbuilder/lispbuilder/tree/master/lispbuilder-sdl/examples) there was confusion based on other sdl 1.2 tutorials.
SDL upgraded from 1.2 to 2.0 with a [good migration document](https://wiki.libsdl.org/MigrationGuide) but [lispbuilder has not upgraded to sdl2](https://github.com/lispbuilder/lispbuilder/issues/18).
To use SDL2 capacity I need to switch to cl-sdl2 and relearn "the new way".


### My Way - Trust BUT verify

I need to extract a series of SDL capacities from my lispbuilder-sdl 1.2 version of code and prototype each capacity in cl-sdl2. Here is the list.

- SDL Init and event loop and key press detection
- SDL Window
- SDL TTF rendering

Give the above my debug facility can be implemented.

- Image reading and display
- Audio reading and playing

If all above is completed a complete game conversion to sdl2 can be done.


## This should be a weeks worth of work.
