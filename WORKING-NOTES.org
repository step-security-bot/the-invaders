* Packaging Issues
I have had bad habit when not understanding how ASDF packaging works.
- system depends are on systems
- packaage depends are on packages (these are lisp packages)
- system are build by file dependacies.

* Analysis
Currently the-invaders.lisp has a series of :import-from why did I do that.
- I believe to cause the package loads as a side effect.
  - Since I do not import and symbols I can remove them and push the side effect loading into my configurator.
  - All :lispbuilder-sdl type packages are never referenced.
    - The SDL package are directly used
    - This implies my configurator needs to load those packages, which are external.

* How I should proceed
- write a configurator that defines that loads the externals.
- See if that runs.
- Next a a branch remmove the lispbuild-sdl references. See if that loads and runs correctly.
  if so merge that into the current branch.
